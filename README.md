# Python-Password-Checker


TITLE :- PASSWORD CHECKER

DESCRIPTION :- Script to check how many times a password has been hacked using Password API

ABOUT THE PROJECT :-

   In this project we are going to build a tool that can be used in real world to securely check if your passwords have ever been hacked. we are going to use 2 types of    methods:-
    
  * Using Console
  * Using Text File
  
  1) Using Console
  
     -> In first type we are going to enter the inputs through console.
  
     -> Here inputs means passwords.
     
     -> We can give any number of inputs by giving spaces.
     
  2) Using Text File
  
     -> In second type we are going to save our passwords in simple text file that is .txt . 
  
     -> We then open our text file and read our passwords line by line.
     
     -> Here also we can save any number of passwords.
     

DATA BREACH :-
   * Our passwords gets leaked all the time. 
   * Ever heard of Data breaches? A data breach is the intentional or unintentional release of secure or private/confidentional information to an untrusted environment.
     example:- facebook, linkdIn, yahoo etc, has been hacked with data breaches.
   * All these companies sometimes leaks their databases therefore, our usernames and passwords gets leaked to the public.
   * Hackers compile these lists of usernames and passwords and try to login to different services.
   

THE OFFICIAL WEBSITE :-
   * As explained above, there are databases or we can think them as massive excel files of all emails and passwords that have ever been leaked throughout the history.
   * Using these databases there is a website called https://haveibeenpwned.com/ created by Troy Hunt where we can check whether our emails or passwords have ever been        pawned or not.
   * But remember even though this website is trustworthy which also uses https a secured way of transferring data, yet we should not trust because the best security is      to not trust anything.
   * Because what happens here is, whenever we enter our passwords or emails it will be transferred to the servers somewhere around the world throught the internet 
   * And that is why we build our own tool in our own PC to securely check our passwords.
   * And this above mentioned website gives us a API called Password API using which we will be builiding our tool.
   
HASH Functions :-
   * One needs to always Hash or Encrypt their passwords before storing it.
   * A Hash function is simply a function that generates a value of fixed length for each given input.
