ABOUT THE PROJECT :-

   In this project we are going to build a tool that can be used in real world to securely check if you passwords have ever been hacked. we are going to use 2 types of    methods:-
    
  * Using Console
  * Using Text File
  
  1) Using Console
  
     -> In first type we are going to enter the inputs through consoles.
  
     -> Here inputs means passwords.
     
     -> We can give any number of inputs by giving spaces.
     
  2) Using Text File
  
     -> In second type we are going to save our passwords in simple text file that is .txt . 
  
     -> We then open our text file and read our passwords line by line.
     
     -> Here also we can save any number of passwords.
